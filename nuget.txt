Notes: despite what the front page of nuget.org implies - you DON'T have to sign a package with a certificate to distribute it

-- from library root folder (with csproj file):
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet publish -c Release
dotnet pack -c Release /p:Version=1.0.0

-- from /bin/Release folder:
dotnet nuget push -s https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json -k <key> Smab.TagHelpers.version.nupkg

git tag -a v1.0.X -m "Published 1.0.X to nuget.org"

git push --follow-tags
